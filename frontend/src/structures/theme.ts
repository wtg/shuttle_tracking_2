/**
 * == How dark theme works in this app ==
 *
 * The current theme mode is saved in the global app settings. `state.settings.darkThemeMode`. This mode defines how
 * the dark theme should be applied. The settings page has a toggle that turns dark theme on or off, and the user can
 * pick which specific mode they want. The settings logic is in `settings.vue` and `store.ts`.
 *
 * The actual theme is implemented via CSS variables and a separate style for dark mode. Elements have their color set
 * not via a direct color, but by referencing a CSS variable. For example, most text elements have their color as
 * `color: var(--color-fg-normal)`. In the normal theme, the fg-normal color is black. When the dark theme is enabled,
 * this variable changes to white. The CSS logic for dark mode is in `theme.ts`.
 *
 * Top-level apps have a `data-theme=` attribute on their root element. This attribute controls the current theme of the
 * app. The value of this attribute is controlled by a computed property that calls {@link DarkTheme#getCurrentCSSThemeAttribute()}.
 * When the theme is updated from the settings menu, Vue magic happens and this computed property updates to the right
 * value according to the settings, enabling or disabling the app dark theme.
